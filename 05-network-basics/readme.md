# üåê Basic Networking

Pods are both ephemeral and "mortal", they should be considered effectively transient. Kubernetes can terminate and reschedule pods for a range of reasons, including rolling updates, scaling up & down and other cluster operations.

Kubernetes solves this with *Services*, which act as a network abstraction over a group of pods, and have their own lifecycle. We can use them to greatly improve what we've deployed

Put a *Service* in front of the MongoDB pods, if you want to create the service YAML yourself, you can [refer to the Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service)

- The type of `Service` should be `ClusterIP` which means it's internal to the cluster only
- The service port should be 27017
- The target port should be 27017
- Selector decides what pods are behind the service, in this case use the label `app` and the value `mongodb`

> üìù NOTE: Labels are metadata that can be added to any object in Kubernetes, they are simply key-value pairs. The label "app" is commonly used, but has **no special meaning**, and isn't used by Kubernetes in any way

A completed YAML manifest for the service is given below:

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1

metadata:
  name: database

spec:
  type: ClusterIP  
  selector:
    app: mongodb
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
      targetPort: 27017
```

</details>

Save your YAML into `mongo-service.yaml` and apply it to the cluster with 

```bash
kubectl apply -f mongo-service.yaml
```

You can use `kubectl` to examine the status of the *Service* just like you can with *Pods* and *Deployments*

```bash
# Get all services
kubectl get svc

# Get details of a single service
kubesctl describe svc database
```

## External access to the Data API

Now we have a service in our cluster we can access our database using DNS rather than pod IP and if the pod(s) die or restart or move; this name remains constant. DNS and Kubernetes is a complex topic we won't get into here, so the main takeway for now is:

- Every Service in the cluster can be resolved over DNS
- If the pods want to call a service inside the same Namespace, you can just use the Service name as the DNS / hostname.
